If the two strings contain the same characters in the same order,
the equals() method returns true. Otherwise, it returns a false value. ...
Main difference between == and equals in Java is that "==" is used to compare
primitives while equals() method is recommended to check equality of objects.


In Java, the constructor is not a method.
It only has the name of the class and a specific visibility.
If it declares that returns something, then it is not a constructor,
not even if it declares that returns a  void


Check file Account.java for notes


long i = 10;

i == 10;

Dog test = new Dog()
Dog test2 = new Dog()

class Object() {
	public 
}

class Dog extends Object {
	private long id;
	private String name;

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}

}

class Terrier extends Dog {

	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name + " teste";
	}
}


Dog dog = new Dog() ===> id = 1
Dog dog2 = new Dog() ===> id = 2

dog == dog2
